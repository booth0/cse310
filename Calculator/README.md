# Overview

This program functions as a simple calculator, using loops, switch cases, and if statements to achieve this effect.
My purpose with this program was to learn the basics of the C++ syntax and use them effectively in a simple project.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used the CLion IDE for this project
With C++, I didn't use any libraries other than the preset ones.

# Future Work

As things are, the program works as intended and can handle errors with the inputs, however, here are some features I would like to add in the future:

- The ability to use calculate more than two values at a time.
- The ability to carry over the result into further calculations.
